Overview 
The third week was dedicated to understanding the concepts of data structures in the Java programming language. We covered the introduction to data structure and LinkedList, went deeper to talk about stack, queue, HashMap and Hashing Function, we also learnt about sorting algorithms, the next two days combined we would learn linear search and binary search, StringBuilder, StringBuffer, BufferedReader, FileReader and InputStreamReader, finally talking about algorithm's runtime analysis & Big-O notation.
